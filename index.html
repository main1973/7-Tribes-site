  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section class="card fade-up" id="about">
    <h2>About 7Tribes (7TRB)</h2>
    <p>7Tribes isn't just a token — it's a blueprint for independence. The mission is simple: redirect the flow of money back into the people's hands. Instead of watching wealth leak out into banks, corporations, and gatekeepers, 7TRB keeps value moving inside the community that built it.</p>

    <h3>The People’s Currency for a New Era</h3>
    <p>7TRB is more than a token — it’s a movement. In a world where the U.S. dollar runs on trust in governments, and Bitcoin runs on trust in code, 7TRB runs on trust in people.</p>
    <p>This is currency built from community, fueled by culture, and strengthened by real-world circulation.</p>
    <p>While old financial systems argue over power, and the digital gold rush chases speculation, 7TRB grows from something deeper: unity, usage, and ownership.</p>
    <p>No institutions. No gatekeepers. No middlemen. Just a tribe committed to building its own value — one wallet, one product, one connection at a time.</p>

    <p><strong>Dollar = Stability.<br>
    Bitcoin = Security.<br>
    7TRB = Potential.</strong></p>

    <p>The future won’t be controlled from the top — it will be built from the community outward. 7TRB is leading that shift: a people-powered economic engine ready to circulate, scale, and uplift.</p>

    <p><strong>Welcome to 7Tribes.<br>
    Welcome to the new standard.<br>
    Welcome to the people’s currency.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <!-- 7 CONTINENTS / PEOPLE / STARTER POOL -->
  <section class="card fade-up">
    <h2>7 Continents, 1 Tribe</h2>

    <h3>Why the Name "7Tribes"?</h3>
    <p>The number 7 represents completion, unity, and power across cultures. Tribes are about people — families, builders, hustlers, farmers, creators — moving as one. 7Tribes = many individuals forming one unstoppable collective.</p>

    <h3>Why People Matter</h3>
    <p>A token without people is just code on a blockchain. 7Tribes only works if people join, participate, and take responsibility. That means:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Holding some 7TRB for the future.</li>
      <li>Spending some with merchants to grow the local economy.</li>
      <li>Bringing in new voices — every sign-up strengthens the network.</li>
      <li>Voting on projects and proposals that matter most.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Together, that unlocks what 7Tribes can become — a living network where every wallet, trade, and purchase builds real community wealth.</p>

    <h3>Build Before You Fund</h3>
    <p>Before 7Tribes can move serious money, it needs serious people — members who believe, builders who create, and merchants who circulate value. The coin’s power comes from circulation, not speculation.</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Role</th>
          <th>Target Count</th>
          <th>Contribution</th>
          <th>Total</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Members</td>
          <td>500</td>
          <td>$25</td>
          <td>$12,500</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Builders</td>
          <td>100</td>
          <td>$50</td>
          <td>$5,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Merchants</td>
          <td>50</td>
          <td>$100</td>
          <td>$5,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Total Starting Pool</strong></td>
          <td>—</td>
          <td>—</td>
          <td><strong>$22,500</strong></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>That’s enough to build early infrastructure — websites, marketing, liquidity, and DAO setup — without outside investors. Every 100 verified members adds credibility. Every merchant accepting 7TRB adds token velocity. Every funded builder adds project capacity.</p>

  <!-- HOW 7TRB BUILDS VALUE -->
  <section class="card fade-up" id="value">
    <h2>🚀 How 7TRB Builds Value</h2>
    <p>The strength of 7TRB doesn’t come from hype — it comes from movement. Here’s how the 7Tribes economy grows stronger, richer, and more resilient over time:</p>

    <h3>💰 1. Value comes from circulation, not sitting still.</h3>
    <p>A currency gains power when it moves. When 7TRB is used to buy goods, fund projects, support builders, or reward tribe members, the ecosystem speeds up. Movement creates demand. Demand creates value.</p>

    <h3>⚙️ 2. Liquidity + demand = the price foundation.</h3>
    <p>Once 7TRB is active on a DEX within the Alkebuleum network, trading pairs form around $AKE and future stable options. More buyers strengthen price; sell pressure cools it down. The community treasury can help stabilize the price by supporting liquidity or buying dips.</p>

    <h3>🌍 3. Scarcity strengthens long-term value.</h3>
    <p>With a fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens, every action matters. Tokens spent, staked, locked, or redeemed increase scarcity — giving each remaining token more power over time.</p>

    <h3>🤝 4. Utility is the engine of sustainability.</h3>
    <p>7TRB becomes more valuable as it becomes more useful. When people use it to shop with merchants, launch Detroit + diaspora projects, unlock rewards, or power community ventures — that’s real economic weight. Utility becomes the backbone of value.</p>

    <h3>🔒 5. Holding 7TRB = holding community power.</h3>
    <p>Holding 7TRB unlocks governance rights, voting power, early access to projects, and future perks. As the tribe grows — more merchants, more builders, more movement — every token you hold represents a larger share of a bigger engine.</p>

    <p><strong>🌱 The Tribe Moves → The Value Moves</strong><br>
    When people join, build, shop, and circulate 7TRB, the currency becomes a living engine. More members. More merchants. More builders. More movement. More value. This is how a people’s currency becomes powerful.</p>

  <!-- HOW TO GET 7TRB -->
  <section class="card fade-up" id="get7trb">
    <h2>How to Get 7TRB</h2>
    <p>7Tribes was built for the people — no middlemen, no big exchanges required. Here’s how to start holding 7TRB:</p>

    <h3>🪙 1. Claim or Earn It</h3>
    <p>Early community members and builders can earn 7TRB through projects, campaigns, and contributions. When the DAO launches, verified builders will be able to claim starter tokens from the community pool.</p>

    <h3>💼 2. Buy on a DEX</h3>
    <p>To buy 7TRB, you’ll need a wallet that supports the Alkebuleum network.</p>
    <ol class="list">
      <li><strong>Download a wallet:</strong> Use AmVault or any Alkebuleum-compatible wallet as more options become available.</li>
      <li><strong>Add funds:</strong> Purchase a small amount of $AKE — the native Alkebuleum token used for swaps and gas fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Connect to the DEX:</strong> Visit JollofSwap (or the official Alkebuleum DEX once live) and connect your wallet.</li>
      <li><strong>Swap into 7TRB:</strong> Paste the official 7TRB contract address from this website, confirm the swap, and complete the trade.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also support 7Tribes directly through Juicebox (Mission 162). Every contribution fuels development and community expansion.</p>

    <h3>💡 Wallet Help</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Gas fees:</strong> All transactions on Alkebuleum require a small amount of $AKE.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> Never share your seed phrase or private keys under any circumstance.</li>
      <li><strong>Networks:</strong> When Alkebuleum becomes fully open to users, add the official network settings in your wallet.</li>
      <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Always check the 7TRB contract address from this site before performing swaps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🛍️ 3. Shop with Merchants</h3>
    <p>Use 7TRB to buy from verified merchants and online shops that accept it. Every time you spend, you’re helping build token velocity and local economic power.</p>

    <h3>🏗️ 4. Build and Get Paid</h3>
    <p>Developers, designers, marketers, and creators can join the builder network. Projects funded through the DAO will pay contributors directly in 7TRB.</p>

    <h3>🔒 5. Hold for Governance</h3>
    <p>The more you hold and participate, the more weight your vote carries. 7TRB is not just currency — it’s your share of voice in what gets built.</p>

    <p><strong>However you get it — claim, earn, buy, or trade — every token in motion strengthens the tribe.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <!-- ON-CHAIN INTEGRATION -->
  <section class="card fade-up" id="onchain">
    <h2>On-Chain Integration &amp; Powered by Alkebuleum</h2>

    <h3>⚙️ 1. You’re on-chain, not just “on a website.”</h3>
    <p>Once 7TRB’s smart contract is deployed to Alkebuleum’s mainnet, every transfer, balance, and DAO vote lives permanently on their blockchain ledger — no middlemen, no banks, no centralized servers.</p>

    <h3>🧩 2. DEX &amp; Ecosystem Integration</h3>
    <p>When Alkebuleum’s DEX (JollofSwap) is live, 7TRB can trade peer-to-peer, pair with $AKE or stable tokens, and plug into liquidity pools, staking, and swaps. That’s visibility + utility in one.</p>

    <h3>🏗️ 3. Verified Network Project</h3>
    <p>Deploying on Alkebuleum positions 7Tribes as a founding community token. You show up in explorers and dashboards — giving devs, partners, and supporters real visibility.</p>

    <h3>💰 4. Independent, Community-Owned</h3>
    <p>Alkebuleum provides the rails, but 7TRB is your economy. The brand, DAO, treasury, and mission stay community-driven. Chain = infrastructure; tribe = power.</p>

    <p><strong>Alkebuleum = the home base.<br>
    7Tribes = the movement that circulates the value.</strong></p>

  <!-- PURPOSE & POSSIBILITIES -->
  <section class="card fade-up" id="purpose">
    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>7Tribes isn't just a token — it's a contract between people. Every trade, every shirt bought, every coin held feeds the community, not billionaires. Decisions are made together and value recycles into local projects.</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Redirect the flow:</strong> from corporations → to neighbors, merchants, and builders.</li>
      <li><strong>Turn believers into builders:</strong> propose work, vote budgets, show receipts.</li>
      <li><strong>Unity = power:</strong> people → token → projects → growth → stronger people.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Possibilities with 7Tribes</h3>
    <p>The power of 7TRB is not in the code, but in the choices people make with it. The more we circulate it, the more doors open:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Local Wealth:</strong> 7TRB spent at local shops stays in the neighborhood.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Projects:</strong> schools, gardens, solar grids, housing — funded transparently from shared wallets.</li>
      <li><strong>Jobs:</strong> developers, artists, marketers, and workers paid directly in 7TRB.</li>
      <li><strong>Global Links:</strong> a system designed here, usable anywhere, connecting communities across borders.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The bigger the tribe, the stronger the effect.</p>

  <!-- DOLLAR vs BITCOIN vs 7TRB -->
  <section class="card fade-up">
    <h2>Dollar vs Bitcoin vs 7TRB — What Truly Backs a Currency?</h2>
    <p>Every currency has a heartbeat — the Dollar runs on governments, Bitcoin runs on math, and 7TRB runs on us. This is where economics becomes community.</p>

    <h3>💵 U.S. Dollar — “The OG Centralized Crypto”</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Backed by:</strong> Government, taxes, global demand</li>
      <li><strong>Drivers:</strong> Interest rates, trade, velocity</li>
      <li><strong>Truth:</strong> 90% digital — powered by trust + motion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>₿ Bitcoin — “Digital Gold of the Internet”</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Backed by:</strong> Code, cryptography, global consensus</li>
      <li><strong>Drivers:</strong> Scarcity, halvings, sentiment</li>
      <li><strong>Truth:</strong> Math-made money — no middlemen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🟡 7TRB — “The People’s Economic Engine”</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Backed by:</strong> Community, circulation, real use</li>
      <li><strong>Drivers:</strong> Holders, movement, ecosystem strength</li>
      <li><strong>Truth:</strong> Value powered by culture + unity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Dollar = Government-backed. Bitcoin = Code-backed. 7TRB = Community-backed.</strong></p>
    <p>Three currencies. Three engines of belief. 7TRB stands at the intersection of culture, technology, and possibility.</p>
