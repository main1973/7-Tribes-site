            7Tribes isn't just a token — it's a blueprint for independence. The mission is simple:
            redirect the flow of money back into the people's hands. Instead of watching wealth leak
            out into banks, corporations, and gatekeepers, 7TRB keeps value moving inside the
            community that built it.

          <p class="muted">
            7TRB is more than a token — it’s a movement. In a world where the U.S. dollar runs on
            trust in governments, and Bitcoin runs on trust in code, 7TRB runs on trust in people.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            This is currency built from community, fueled by culture, and strengthened by
            real-world circulation.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            While old financial systems argue over power, and the digital gold rush chases
            speculation, 7TRB grows from something deeper: unity, usage, and ownership.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            No institutions. No gatekeepers. No middlemen. Just a tribe committed to building its
            own value — one wallet, one product, one connection at a time.
          </p>

          <p class="center strong">
            Dollar = Stability.<br />
            Bitcoin = Security.<br />
            7TRB = Potential.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            The future won’t be controlled from the top — it will be built from the community
            outward. 7TRB is leading that shift: a people-powered economic engine ready to
            circulate, scale, and uplift.

          <h4>Why the Name "7Tribes"?</h4>
          <p class="muted">
            The number 7 represents completion, unity, and power across cultures. Tribes are about
            people — families, builders, hustlers, farmers, creators — moving as one.
            7Tribes = many individuals forming one unstoppable collective.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="box">
          <h3>Why People Matter</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            A token without people is just code on a blockchain. 7Tribes only works if people join,
            participate, and take responsibility. That means:
          </p>
          <ul class="muted">
            <li>Holding some 7TRB for the future.</li>
            <li>Spending some with merchants to grow the local economy.</li>
            <li>Bringing in new voices — every sign-up strengthens the network.</li>
            <li>Voting on projects and proposals that matter most.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            Together, that unlocks what 7Tribes can become — a living network where every wallet,
            trade, and purchase builds real community wealth.
          </p>

          <h3>Build Before You Fund</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Before 7Tribes can move serious money, it needs serious people — members who believe,
            builders who create, and merchants who circulate value. The coin’s power comes from
            circulation, not speculation.

            <p class="muted">
              Once 7TRB’s smart contract is deployed to Alkebuleum’s mainnet, every transfer,
              balance, and DAO vote lives permanently on their blockchain ledger — no middlemen, no
              banks, no centralized servers.

            <p class="muted">
              When Alkebuleum’s DEX (JollofSwap) is live, 7TRB can trade peer-to-peer, pair with
              $AKE or stable tokens, and plug into liquidity pools, staking, and swaps. That’s
              visibility + utility in one.

            <p>🏗️ <strong>3. Verified Network Project</strong></p>
            <p class="muted">
              Deploying on Alkebuleum positions 7Tribes as a founding community token. You show up
              in explorers and dashboards — giving devs, partners, and supporters real visibility.

              Alkebuleum provides the rails, but 7TRB is your economy. The brand, DAO, treasury, and

                7Tribes isn't just a token — it's a contract between people. Every trade, every shirt
                bought, every coin held feeds the community, not billionaires. Decisions are made
                together and value recycles into local projects.

              <h3>Possibilities with 7Tribes</h3>
              <p class="muted">
                The power of 7TRB is not in the code, but in the choices people make with it. The
                more we circulate it, the more doors open:

                <li>
                  <b>Community Projects:</b> schools, gardens, solar grids, housing — funded
                  transparently from shared wallets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Jobs:</b> developers, artists, marketers, and workers paid directly in 7TRB.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Global Links:</b> a system designed here, usable anywhere, connecting communities

                Every currency has a heartbeat — the Dollar runs on governments, Bitcoin runs on
                math, and 7TRB runs on us. This is where economics becomes community.

         HOW 7TRB BUILDS VALUE
    ================================== -->
    <section class="section" id="value">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2 class="title">How 7TRB Builds Value</h2>
        <article class="box">
          <p class="muted">
            The strength of 7TRB doesn’t come from hype — it comes from movement. Here’s how the
            7Tribes economy grows stronger, richer, and more resilient over time:
          </p>

          <p>💰 <b>1. Value comes from circulation, not sitting still.</b></p>
          <p class="muted">
            A currency gains power when it moves. When 7TRB is used to buy goods, fund projects,
            support builders, or reward tribe members, the ecosystem speeds up. Movement creates
            demand. Demand creates value.
          </p>

          <p>⚙️ <b>2. Liquidity + demand = the price foundation.</b></p>
          <p class="muted">
            Once 7TRB is active on a DEX within the Alkebuleum network, trading pairs form around
            $AKE and future stable options. More buyers strengthen price; sell pressure cools it
            down. The community treasury can help stabilize the price by supporting liquidity or
            buying dips.
          </p>

          <p>🌍 <b>3. Scarcity strengthens long-term value.</b></p>
          <p class="muted">
            With a fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens, every action matters. Tokens spent, staked,
            locked, or redeemed increase scarcity — giving each remaining token more power over
            time.
          </p>

          <p>🤝 <b>4. Utility is the engine of sustainability.</b></p>
          <p class="muted">
            7TRB becomes more valuable as it becomes more useful. When people use it to shop with
            merchants, launch Detroit + diaspora projects, unlock rewards, or power community
            ventures — that’s real economic weight. Utility becomes the backbone of value.
          </p>

          <p>🔒 <b>5. Holding 7TRB = holding community power.</b></p>
          <p class="muted">
            Holding 7TRB unlocks governance rights, voting power, early access to projects, and
            future perks. As the tribe grows — more merchants, more builders, more movement — every
            token you hold represents a larger share of a bigger engine.
          </p>

          <p class="muted strong">
            🌱 The Tribe Moves → The Value Moves
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            When people join, build, shop, and circulate 7TRB, the currency becomes a living engine.
            More members. More merchants. More builders. More movement. More value. This is how a
            people’s currency becomes powerful.

         HOW TO GET 7TRB
    ================================== -->

      <div class="wrap">
        <h2 class="title">How to Get 7TRB</h2>

        <article class="box">
          <p class="muted">
            7Tribes was built for the people — no middlemen, no big exchanges required. Here’s how
            to start holding 7TRB:
          </p>

          <h3>🪙 1. Claim or Earn It</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Early community members and builders can earn 7TRB through projects, campaigns, and
            contributions. When the DAO launches, verified builders will be able to claim starter
            tokens from the community pool.
          </p>

          <h3>💼 2. Buy on a DEX</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            To buy 7TRB, you’ll need a wallet that supports the Alkebuleum network.
          </p>
          <ol class="muted">
            <li><b>Download a wallet:</b> Use AmVault or any Alkebuleum-compatible wallet as more options become available.</li>
            <li><b>Add funds:</b> Purchase a small amount of $AKE — the native Alkebuleum token used for swaps and gas fees.</li>
            <li><b>Connect to the DEX:</b> Visit JollofSwap (or the official Alkebuleum DEX once live) and connect your wallet.</li>
            <li><b>Swap into 7TRB:</b> Paste the official 7TRB contract address from this website, confirm the swap, and complete the trade.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="muted">
            You can also support 7Tribes directly through Juicebox (Mission 162). Every contribution
            fuels development and community expansion.
          </p>

          <div class="box soft">
            <h4>💡 Wallet Help</h4>
            <ul class="muted">
              <li><b>Gas fees:</b> All transactions on Alkebuleum require a small amount of $AKE.</li>
              <li><b>Security:</b> Never share your seed phrase or private keys under any circumstance.</li>
              <li><b>Networks:</b> When Alkebuleum becomes fully open to users, add the official network settings in your wallet.</li>
              <li><b>Verification:</b> Always check the 7TRB contract address from this site before performing swaps.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>🛍️ 3. Shop with Merchants</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Use 7TRB to buy from verified merchants and online shops that accept it. Every time you
            spend, you’re helping build token velocity and local economic power.
          </p>

          <h3>🏗️ 4. Build and Get Paid</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Developers, designers, marketers, and creators can join the builder network. Projects
            funded through the DAO will pay contributors directly in 7TRB.
          </p>

          <h3>🔒 5. Hold for Governance</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            The more you hold and participate, the more weight your vote carries. 7TRB is not just
            currency — it’s your share of voice in what gets built.
          </p>

          <p class="muted strong">
            However you get it — claim, earn, buy, or trade — every token in motion strengthens the
            tribe.
