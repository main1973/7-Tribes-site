    <h1>About 7Tribes (7TRB)</h1>
    <p>
      7Tribes is more than a cryptocurrency — it’s a movement for unity, empowerment, 
      and economic independence. The success of 7TRB depends on community participation. 
      We need people to join, share, and support this project so that resources stay in 
      our communities instead of being extracted by outside systems. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Every person counts. Protesting alone won’t bring change — but building an economic 
      solution together can. By standing united under one token, we build real power.

    <h2>How 7TRB Will Launch</h2>
    <p>
      Launching 7TRB requires both funding and participation. Here’s the breakdown of what’s needed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Token Liquidity Pool:</strong> $1,000 – $3,000 (to provide initial market trading)</li>
      <li><strong>Website & Hosting:</strong> $100 – $300</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing & Outreach:</strong> $500 – $1,000</li>
      <li><strong>Community Development:</strong> $200 – $500</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Total Goal:</strong> $3,000 – $5,000 to fully launch and sustain 7TRB.  
    </p>
    <p>
      But it’s not only about money — it’s about <strong>participation in conception</strong>. 
      Everyone who joins now is part of shaping how 7Tribes grows. Early supporters help decide:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How resources are distributed</li>
      <li>What projects we invest in</li>
      <li>How to keep the community united</li>
    </ul>
